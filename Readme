Cherry Blossom Prediction Project


•Project Overview

This project aims to predict cherry blossom bloom dates across five global locations—Washington, D.C., New York City, Vancouver, Liestal-Weideli (Switzerland), and Kyoto (Japan)—by integrating historical bloom records with meteorological variables. We employ machine learning models to analyze the relationship between climate factors such as maximum temperature (TMAX), minimum temperature (TMIN), average temperature (TAVG), and precipitation (PRCP) with bloom timing.

To improve the accuracy and reliability of cherry blossom bloom predictions, feature engineering was conducted by integrating biological, climatological, and temporal variables. These features were selected to capture the seasonal temperature accumulation, precipitation trends, and long-term climate shifts that influence bloom timing across different geographic regions.


•Temperature-Based Predictors

Temperature is a primary driver of cherry blossom phenology. Several temperature-related variables were incorporated to enhance the model’s ability to capture thermal accumulation and variability:
	•	Maximum Temperature (TMAX), Minimum Temperature (TMIN), and Average Temperature (TAVG) were used to assess the thermal conditions influencing bud development.
	•	Diurnal Temperature Range (TMAX - TMIN) was included to account for temperature fluctuations that may accelerate or delay bloom timing.
	•	Cumulative Growing Degree Days (GDD_cumsum) measured heat accumulation above a 5°C threshold, a critical determinant of the transition from dormancy to bloom.
	•	Temperature Lags (TMAX_LAG, TMIN_LAG, TAVG_LAG) were computed over 10-day and 30-day periods to capture the delayed effects of temperature variations on bloom onset.
	•	Rolling Averages (TAVG_30D, TAVG_60D) were incorporated to assess long-term warming or cooling trends that may influence bloom variability.

Precipitation and Hydrological Variables

Precipitation plays a crucial role in soil moisture availability and tree hydration, particularly in monsoon-influenced regions such as Kyoto. The following precipitation-based features were added to the dataset:
	•	Total Precipitation (PRCP) was included as a direct climatic factor affecting bloom cycles.
	•	Cumulative Precipitation (PRCP_cumsum) provided insight into seasonal moisture trends leading up to bloom events.
	•	Precipitation Lag Effects (PRCP_LAG1, PRCP_LAG30) captured the influence of short-term and long-term precipitation variability on bloom onset.

Solar Radiation and Photoperiodicity

The effect of solar exposure and photoperiod was considered to account for regional differences in daylight duration and energy availability for bud development:
	•	Daylength and Photoperiod (estimated based on latitude and date) were incorporated to analyze their effects on bloom timing, particularly in higher-latitude locations.
	•	Sunshine Duration (where available) was included as a potential influencing factor in temperature accumulation and photosynthesis-driven processes.

Climatic and Geographic Adjustments

Cherry blossom timing is also affected by broader climatic trends and regional geographical factors. To address these considerations, the following variables were included:
	•	Temperature Anomalies (ΔTAVG, ΔGDD) were introduced to assess deviations from historical norms and climate change influences.
	•	Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude were included as geographic variables to account for regional climate variations, such as higher elevation delaying bloom onset due to lower temperatures.
	•	Urban Heat Island Effect (for New York City and Washington, D.C.) was factored in to adjust for higher urban temperatures that may advance bloom timing compared to surrounding rural areas.

Methodology

We tested multiple models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Bayesian Ridge, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores, XGBoost and Random Forest emerged as the most accurate models for bloom date prediction, effectively capturing non-linear climate-bloom interactions. Kyoto’s growing degree days (GDD_cumsum) and precipitation-driven monsoon effects were also incorporated for better biological relevance.

Key Findings
	•	Climate trends and temperature variability significantly impact bloom dates.
	•	Regional models perform best when trained on location-specific climate indicators.
	•	Data limitations (e.g., New York City’s sparse historical records) introduce uncertainty.
	•	Machine learning models can enhance phenological forecasting but require continuous updates with real-time data.

Next Steps & Future Work
